  ## Will need to download "Country-Data-2016" dataset, will need to write a code to load that data into a data frame labeled "d"
    -It may be ideal to upload the data file into this repo then assign file paths to github locale
  will summarize the variables: how many variables, how many observations, how many countries, median area and pop size for each country, create a new density variable defined by pop / area. Which are the 10 most dense, or 10 least dense? ##
