##This file will contain short code lists for commonly required functions, particularly in regards to using git and loading libraries

##Package runner##
install.packages("tidyverse", "usethis", "skimr")
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
library(skimr)

##git activator##
git clone <>
## Must be done in terminal. In place of <>, use the https link of your repo obtained from github. Ideally, set your working directory to your repo folder first

##git quick upload##
git add -A
git commit -m "Version update"
git push

## Plot construction ##
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x="", y=log(Body_mass_female_mean))) + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + geom_jitter(col = "blue")
## ggplot allows you to create more complex plots. aes requires two arguments: x value and y value. the "+ geom_" function adds an additional plot layer to
the overall plot structure. In this case, it superimposes a boxplot of the data with a jitter plot of individual data points.##
